In this lab we were supposed to learn and accomplish making a file that was in morse code and reading it by line and
translating it to english. The steps we used to solve this problem were figuring out the major tasks of the lab, writing
the algorithm, and then splitting up the coding between the three of us. To do so we each committed and pushed a part of
the code to create the entire program and eventually be successful. The key concepts explored were reading a file, 
reading a file to a list, splitting the list, translating the list to english, creating and putting the list into a
dictionary, and then writing the list to a file. The results I expected to and the results that we got match our results.
We tried various test cases and extreme test cases with our coding to make sure our functions and coding had no errors or
issues. One of the challenges we encountered was with the functions but we were able to solve it after finding the niche
problem and using our notes and resources to solve it. We followed the first three rules of programming by planning our
way of tackling the problem, creating a human readable essay, and then practicing our code several times. A key takeaway
I have from this lab is that working with two partners is so much more fun then just one partner. I think I learned what
I was supposed to in this lab without feeling overwhelmed with too much work. Working with Hazel and Oreoluwa was 
fantastic! They are great partners and communicate well.
