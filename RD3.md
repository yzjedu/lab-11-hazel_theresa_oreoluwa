**What were you supposed to learn/accomplish?**

A program that reads morse code from a file and translates it to english.

**What steps were followed and what techniques did you use to solve the problem?**

First we read the read me file and talked about how to solve the problem. Afterwords, we worked on the algorithm, and then the code.

**What were the Key concepts explored?**
We deepened our understanding of pair programming, dictionaries, files, and creating functions

**Did your results match what you expected to get?**

Yes. 

**Did you try using various test cases, or extreme test cases?**

Yes. We have error checking for user input, that stops the code from crashing when extreme cases are input.

**What challenges did you encounter?**

We had some issues writing the translated code to an output file

**How did you follow the first 3 rules of programming?**
1. Think before Programming: We read the read me file, and completed our algorithm before starting to program.
2. Program is the embodiment of the algorithm: Our code follows our algorithm
3. Improve through practice: We improved our pair programming / coding skills by completing this lab.


**Did you overcome them, and how?**

Yes, after looking back on our notes we realized that we were not splitting and stripping the function properly

**Any key takeaways?**

Planning before programming is very important.

**Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab?**

Yes I do. I feel much more comfortable with file work and dictionaries.

**What was it like working with your partner?**

Very good. We were able to communicate efficiently despite having 3 people/
