The goal of this lab was to decode Morse code into English using Python. The focus was to practice file handling, dictionary lookups, and modular 
programming while building a user-friendly program that validates input, handles errors, and produces accurate results.

The program was broken into smaller tasks: validating file input, reading files into lists, creating a Morse code dictionary, converting Morse code 
to English, and writing the output to a file. Each function was tested individually before integrating them. Techniques like file validation, 
dictionary lookups, and string manipulation were used to ensure the program worked efficiently.

The program produced the expected results.

The main challenges were file validation, handling edge cases, and improving user prompts. To address these, loops ensured valid input, non-existent files 
were flagged with error messages, and prompts were revised for clarity. The first three programming rules were followed: making the program functional 
first, adding error handling to make it correct, and ensuring efficiency with dictionary lookups. Key takeaways included the importance of modular 
design and anticipating edge cases. Working with my partners was collaborative. We split the 6 functions equally amongst ourselves and helped
each other when we had problems. We communicated effectively too!
Overall, the lab was a valuable learning experience that reinforced key concepts in programming and teamwork.
